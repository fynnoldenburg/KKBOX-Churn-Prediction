# KKBOX-Churn-Prediction

Group project for the course 2487_A-Machine Learning TA-2122_S2.

KKBOX is Asia’s leading music streaming service, holding the world’s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. They offer a generous, unlimited version of their service to millions of people, supported by advertising and paid subscriptions. This delicate model is dependent on accurately predicting churn of their paid users.

Can you predict whether a user will churn after his/her subscription expires?

 ## Workflow
 
 [**Data Understanding:**](kkbox_data_understanding.ipynb)
 *Analysis of available data files and attribute structure and processing into one file to continue with*
 
 [**Data Processing & Modelling:**](kkbox_machine_learning.ipynb)
 *First version of data pre-processing and fitting Decision Tree model (already 0.93 accuracy)*
 
 - [ ] Expand on pre-processing methods (feature scaling?, dimensionality reduction? ...)
 - [ ] Implement feature selection methods

 - [ ] Set up pipeline

 - [ ] Expand on models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Neural Network ...)
 - [ ] Set up data validation procedure (which measures are most relevant for the problem?)

 - [ ] Experiment different combinations of the processing & modelling processes to find best model
