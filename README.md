# KKBOX-Churn-Prediction

Group project for the course 2487_A-Machine Learning TA-2122_S2.

KKBOX is Asia’s leading music streaming service, holding the world’s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. They offer a generous, unlimited version of their service to millions of people, supported by advertising and paid subscriptions. This delicate model is dependent on accurately predicting churn of their paid users.

Can you predict whether a user will churn after his/her subscription expires?
